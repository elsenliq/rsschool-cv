### _About me_

---

Currently studying German and English philology. I’ve already tried **_HTML/CSS, UX/UI design, data analytics, and even some Python_**, honestly i did that for pure curiosity at first, but now i feel like i want to take it more serious and try working as the programmer.

I’ve worked as a hostess, bartender, and waitress in Aida Café, Innsbruck, Austria.

> Although I picked up great customer service and teamwork skills, i surely wouldn't ever wanted to work in a service sector, so I realized that programming would be a better choice to start with.

I’m responsible, always up for learning something new, and looking for a tech job that feels more like a hobby I'd love. I’m excited to find a profession that helps me grow and enjoy what I do.
